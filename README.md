## Two versions

- If you just want the particle-effect, [ConnectedParticles](https://github.com/johnnyawesome/ConnectedParticles/tree/master/ConnectedParticles)

- If you want the particles to avoid your mouse, take [ConnectedParticlesVector](https://github.com/johnnyawesome/ConnectedParticles/tree/master/ConnectedParticlesVector)

## Info

This is the stupid particle effect you see on every homepage.
Even [Processing.org](https://processing.org/) has a version of it on it's very frontpage.

I always disliked it, and so I thought I'll make my own, to be done with it forever!

## Background

The version in which the particles avoid the mouse uses *vectors*.
I avoided those like tha plague so far, because, you know, vectors.

If you too think they're complicated, have a look at this project. It turns out they're not so bad! ðŸ˜‰
