# ConnectedParticles
A particle-effect written in JavaScript using P5JS

## Two versions

- If you just want the particle-effect, [ConnectedParticles](https://github.com/johnnyawesome/ConnectedParticles/tree/master/ConnectedParticles)

- If you want the particles to avoid your mouse, take [ConnectedParticlesVector](https://github.com/johnnyawesome/ConnectedParticles/tree/master/ConnectedParticlesVector)

## Info

The version in which the particles avoid the mouse uses *vectors*.
I avoided those like tha plague so far, because, you know, vectors.

If you too think they're complicated, have a look at this project. It turns out they're not so bad! ðŸ˜‰
